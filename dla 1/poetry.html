<p align="left">I. Erosions </br>
</br>
I known green lawns, the tomorrow-scented lush— </br>
the crags understand empty but I loved, have loved, </br>
this throat, like you, </br>
this touchable shape.</br>
This miniature kingdom. Things slow, but aren't silenced. </br>
I wait in trying, low over your bones. </br>
Have I never not been so foolish that </br>
when I wake up</br>
</br>
and honey flows from the flush behind my front, center the earth </br>
red earth; remembered words and a spilling, </br>
you talk about its mysteries and pluck it ripe from me.</br>
This holy god is not sharing. </br>
the grass, they can still taste another’s tongue, </br>
an odyssey in what they said. </br>
once there was the right star against my heart,</br>
the very sense, because nothing is cracking, a love I only know. And all these losses. They are smaller now. The truth? Or mirrors; refracting </br>everything you have seen, you, my own. </br>
Here is a cold day in the heat, in all we have eroded.</br>
crevices ooze from that white fence the gray dusk - and yet. </br>
Show no motive for your mouth, on your image.</br>
Revere wants to the tides.</br>
I believe only a little bit</br>
of the music from your lips, </br>
dripping sweet like nectar</br>
ambrosia and wine.</br>
</br>
Fate has the wisdom that can wash this spot out, blot out mistakes.</br>
Show no loneliness; you exist in a way of decay. </br>
If I could reach that silence—</br>
If I have eroded—</br>
no—</br>
For you, anthrophilius, lover of flowers, </br>
</br>
the garden blooms. </br>
and the bees, buzzing, come down to collect the pollen on their tiny furred legs,</br>
float into the yellow sky. </br>
</p>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<p align="center">II. Gravitations</br>
</br>
Time moves in circles</br>
cyclical, slickly slicing.</br>
I am shocked with rain. </br>
</br>
The gods are in hell, </br>
the feet are cold. </br>
Now is touchable to the mind, let it approach, </br>
sweetly, just like one prepared.</br>
I would propose in the ocean silence </br>
in such a field of mortality under the orange sun.</br>
In the heat fade, blooming, we transition.</br>
I feel, so much, </br>
what was once speechless.</br>
smother like waves that elusive and </br>
roaring warmth of a soul that is your bodies; </br>
shining in the paper lantern glory.</br>
</br>
There they do not give up.</br>
Here immortals? </br>
Fate has a fish? </br>
They are getting a boy now.</br>
</br>
It's very mortal. fleshy. filled with him; </br>
into color but indigo pale, arms around it. </br>
They know my name; </br>
they know it in the way of the dirt of a campfire when I sleep. </br>
This night, the atmosphere is wrong.</br>
Love belongs to catch your skin, </br>
who else felt it once; someone would have.</br>
Bright beyond that beautiful mind, </br>
sweet juice sparkling </br>
to take me in heat, </br>
and all in all my heart’s a good one—</br>
refracting glory, blue and smoke. </br>
unmarred, yes, the hallowed blooming out, </br>
after and after the stories.</br>
But I will not be one prepared for eternity. </br>
That beautiful silence. That waiting space. </br>
I do not regret that last sunrise. The dawns could not erase me.</br>
</br>
I don't miss my heartline, you stepped through it</br>
just out onto the ocean silenced for eternal love. </br>
</p>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<p align="right">III. Silences</br>
</br>

For you, astrophile, lover of stars—</br>
</br>
the light shines brightest when no one is looking. </br>
how beauty minds death, </br>
so far from the twilight within him - remembered under your own tree.</br>
there are things I know; </br>
like I know that I have loved you, </br>
</br>
once mortals?</br>
entwined, </br>
two ships, passing.</br>
</br>
and lately I'm beginning to look at the light in hell. The heavy venus, </br>
who sings in this aching </br>
without, she has wisdom to be.</br>
