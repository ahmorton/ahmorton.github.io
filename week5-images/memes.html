<p> I. Erosions
I known green lawns, the tomorrow-scented lush—
the crags understand empty but I loved, have loved, 
this throat, like you, 
this touchable shape.
This miniature kingdom. Things slow, but aren't silenced. 
I wait in trying, low over your bones. 
Have I never not been so foolish that 
when I wake up

and honey flows from the flush behind my front, center the earth 
red earth; remembered words and a spilling, 
you talk about its mysteries and pluck it ripe from me.
This holy god is not sharing. 
the grass, they can still taste another’s tongue, 
an odyssey in what they said. 
once there was the right star against my heart,
the very sense, because nothing is cracking, a love I only know. And all these losses. They are smaller now. The truth? Or mirrors; refracting everything you have seen, you, my own. 
Here is a cold day in the heat, in all we have eroded.
crevices ooze from that white fence the gray dusk - and yet. 
Show no motive for your mouth, on your image.
Revere wants to the tides.
I believe only a little bit
of the music from your lips, 
dripping sweet like nectar
ambrosia and wine.

Fate has the wisdom that can wash this spot out, blot out mistakes.
Show no loneliness; you exist in a way of decay. 
If I could reach that silence—
If I have eroded—
no—
For you, anthrophilius, lover of flowers, 

the garden blooms. 
and the bees, buzzing, come down to collect the pollen on their tiny furred legs,
float into the yellow sky. 






II. Gravitations

Time moves in circles
cyclical, slickly slicing.
I am shocked with rain. 

The gods are in hell, 
the feet are cold. 
Now is touchable to the mind, let it approach, 
sweetly, just like one prepared.
I would propose in the ocean silence 
in such a field of mortality under the orange sun.
In the heat fade, blooming, we transition.
I feel, so much, 
what was once speechless.
smother like waves that elusive and 
roaring warmth of a soul that is your bodies; 
shining in the paper lantern glory.

There they do not give up.
Here immortals? 
Fate has a fish? 
They are getting a boy now.

It's very mortal. fleshy. filled with him; 
into color but indigo pale, arms around it. 
They know my name; 
they know it in the way of the dirt of a campfire when I sleep. 
This night, the atmosphere is wrong.
Love belongs to catch your skin, 
who else felt it once; someone would have.
Bright beyond that beautiful mind, 
sweet juice sparkling 
to take me in heat, 
and all in all my heart’s a good one—
refracting glory, blue and smoke. 
unmarred, yes, the hallowed blooming out, 
after and after the stories.
But I will not be one prepared for eternity. 
That beautiful silence. That waiting space. 
I do not regret that last sunrise. The dawns could not erase me.

I don't miss my heartline, you stepped through it
just out onto the ocean silenced for eternal love. 



III. Silences

For you, astrophile—

the light shines brightest when no one is looking. 
how beauty minds death, 
so far from the twilight within him - remembered under your own tree.
there are things I know; 
like I know that I have loved you, 

once mortals?
entwined, 
two ships, passing.

and lately I'm beginning to look at the light in hell. The heavy venus, 
who sings in this aching 
without, she has wisdom to be.
