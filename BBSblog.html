hahaha I just love how Biker Brain Surgeon always keeps on his biker leathers, and only puts on a hospital mask and gloves when he operates</p>

<p> NEW THREAD: what's your fave quote from the latest season? I'll start it off!</br></br>
	In operating room: "Nurse, scalpel." She gives it to him. </br>
	Police officer comes bursting in. "Biker Brain Surgeon, you're under arrest!" </br>
	"Nurse, gun." She slaps a gun into his hand and he shoots the police officer. </br>
	"Not before I save this man's life. And I'm going to save your life, too. Put him on the other table." </br>
	They put him on the other table and BBS operates on him too and saves his life. </br>
	"You're under arrest!" </br>
	"I saved your life. You're in my debt now." </br>
	"How can I ever repay you?" </br>
	"Don't arrest me." </br>
	"Thank you, Biker Brain Surgeon."</p>

Open skull guy: "Well you're the doctor!" </p>

At gang fight, with his gang and opposing gang. Starts out as a discussion, turns into a fight. BBS: "This is going south." Holds out his hand: "Gun." And someone gives him a gun like a nurse would give him a scalpel.

"I may have taken the Hippocratic Oath, but I also took the biker oath." Title: Biker Brain Surgeon. As he rides off on a road with rock music in the background. </p>

"I'm going to break your knee in a medically sound fashion and give you anesthetic and you won't feel a thing, until it wears off and I break your other knee so you tell me where my stolen heroin is.

Nurse: "Biker Brain Surgeon, you need to operate! This man is going to die!" </br>
BBS: "First I need to finish this deal for 12 kilos of coke. Death will have to wait." </p>

Biker Brain Surgeon does a delicate operation on one of his men in the middle of a gang fight.  "Hang on Tommy Three Knives, I'll have to use one of your knives to open your brain, so I can save you.  No one dies today, no one dies on my watch, and no one dies in one of my gang fights. Unless they crossed me. Then I'll shoot them. But then I'll save them. No one dies." </p>

In the middle of a drug deal: "Just got a call from the hospital. It's time to operate." "Close this deal!"  "Not today."  And he walks out. Puts the siren on his motorcycle, put his sunglasses on, and drives away, staring at the guy until he's out of sight.</p>

Biker Brain Surgeon keeps almost killing the same man, and then saving his life. "I've saved this man 17 times, and I'm going to kill him again in an hour for stealing my car.  Then I'll save him.  Because no one dies today except this guy occasionally." </p>
<p> <a href="http://ahmorton.github.com/">roadbneathurwheelz</a> <i>replied</i>: </br>
"Isn't there any other surgeon who can do the operation?"  That's open skull guy again.
"I'm the only (biker) brain surgeon in 300 miles." </p>
