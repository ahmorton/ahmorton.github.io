	"S": ["'The #being# #verb# #attribute#': Once guilty of the deadly sin of #sin#, #age# Viking vampire angel #hero# is now a lean, mean, vampire-devil fighting machine. His new side-job? No biggie: just ridding the world of a threat called #threat# while keeping the evil Lucipires (demon vampires) at bay. So when #profession# #heroPet# hires him to rescue her #relation# from a cult recruiting terrorists at a #place#, vangel turns cowboy. #Exclamation.capitalize#! The #adjective# mortal insists on accompanying him, surprising him with her #skill# at every turn. But with terrorists stalking the ranch in demonoid form, the vangel teletransports his #petname# and himself out of danger — accidentally into the #timeperiod# #location#. Suddenly, they have to find their way back to the future to save her family and the world . . . and to satisfy their insatiable attraction.", "'#adj1# and #adj2#': It takes nothing short of a miracle to catapult Lt. #hero# #ProtagLastName# and his team of Navy SEALs back in time to the eleventh-century Norselands. First on the agenda: destroy the evil villain who terrorized his family and a nation. But when the sexy SEALs find they’ve landed in the middle of a sanctuary—filled with women—well, #Exclamation#! Their plans are put on hold, much to the distress of Hilda, the head of the sanctuary. At first resistant to Torolf’s pursuits, she soon succumbs to his passionate advances. Suddenly the term “Special Forces” takes on a whole new meaning. But with victory in sight for Torolf, Hilda must face the fact that their love may not survive the test of time...", "'Good Vampires Go To Heaven': Two-thousand-year-old vampire demon #hero# is supposed to spend eternity turning mortal sinners into bad guy Lucipires like himself. That way, they can grow their numbers and fight the vampire angels known as Vangels. But Zeb is a bad boy in a good way—secretly working as a double agent for none other than St. Michael the Archangel in hopes of one day earning his wings. Problem is, Zeb’s betrayal is discovered. Hello, demon dungeon.  HE WAS VERY BAD . . .  Until Regina, a foxy, flame-haired Vangel witch on a rescue mission, busts out Zeb, along with three oddball Lucipire witches. Hello, temptation!  BUT TOGETHER THEY WERE VERY GOOD . . . !  Their escape unleashes a war to defeat all Vangels forevermore. In an epic madcap battle between good and evil, a Demon just might earn his wings . . . and spend eternity with the Vangel of his wildest dreams.", "'The Love Potion': A love potion in a jelly bean?  Fame and fortune are surely only a swallow away when Dr. Sylvie Fontaine discovers a chemical formula guaranteed to attract the opposite sex. Though her own love life is purely hypothetical, the shy chemist's professional future is assured . . . as soon as she can find a human guinea pig. The only problem is the wrong man has swallowed Sylvie's love potion. Bad boy Lucien LeDeux is more than she can handle even before he's dosed with the Jelly Bean Fix. The wildly virile lawyer is the last person she'd choose to subject to the scientific method. When the dust settles, Sylvie and Luc have the answers to some burning questions: Can a man die of testosterone overload? Can a straightlaced female lose every single one of her inhibitions? And they learn that old-fashioned romance is still the best catalyst for love."],
