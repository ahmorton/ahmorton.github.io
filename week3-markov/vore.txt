we were eating oysters(a classic aphrodisiac)and I was entrancedby your mouth, your lips,your pink tongue, flicking outto catch the last drop;your throat, swallowingand I thought of the oyster, sliding down that dark, tight spaceinside the smooth column of your neck,the mysterious mechanisms of your body.and maybe it was the oystersand maybe it was youbut all I know is I want youand I want to know youall the secret parts of youhidden from the world,hot and tight and wetand to think that you mightclench around me, squeeze me, choke me, it’s overwhelming and all I want is to be a part of you, one with you, a perfect union in perfect harmony— I can’t tell if you notice me staringhungrily at your gulletas another oyster disappears with a slurpinto that secret space, the caverns of you,but surely you can feel the heat coming off meas I lean into you and you must knowthat this want is a need and I’m drooling for you,eyes blown wide, begging, for just onebite
